Hi, I'm Armaan. Welcome to my personal blog!

I'm a **Senior Solutions Architect** working in the **Generative AI** space. My career has been spent at the intersection of complex technology and the people who use it, including time in software engineering and management.

This blog is my space to explore all the things I'm curious about. You'll find a mix of professional and personal posts, covering my main interests:

- **Technology:** Deep dives into **databases** and the rapidly evolving world of **AI/ML** from a solutions-oriented perspective.
- **History:** Exploring stories and events from the past that still shape our present.
- **Travel:** Sharing insights and guides from my adventures.

I'm driven by a curiosity for how things work—whether it's a large language model or an ancient civilization.

Thanks for stopping by!
